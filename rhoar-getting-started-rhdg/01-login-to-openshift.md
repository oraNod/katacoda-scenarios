**Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform** is the preferred runtime for Red Hat Data Grid and is based on the **Kubernetes** container-orchestration system.

If you are new to OpenShift, you should complete [Introduction to OpenShift]( https://learn.openshift.com/introduction/) before you start this tutorial.


**1. Logging in to OpenShift**

Run the **oc login** command as follows:

`oc login -u developer -p developer`{{execute}}

This command authenticates you to OpenShift with the following credentials:
* Username: **developer**
* Password: **developer**

**2. Creating a project**

Create a [project](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.html#projects) for your RHDG application as follows:

`oc new-project example --display-name="Simple RHDG REST App"`{{execute}}

**3. Opening the OpenShift console**

OpenShift provides a console that lets you work with application deployments from a browser window.

1. Select the "OpenShift Console" tab to launch the console in your browser.

The console displays the projects that you can work with.

3. Select the "Simple RHDG REST App" project that you created to view all of the resources available in your project:

At the moment your project does not have any available applications or resources. Proceed to the next section and start creating a deployment.
